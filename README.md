 ðŸ›’ D-Mart Power BI Sales Dashboard
Once upon a time... in the world of retail giants, D-Mart wanted to make sense of its massive sales data.
ðŸ“¦ From groceries to gadgets, thousands of products, hundreds of locations, and lakhs of customers â€” but how to see it all in one glance?

Thatâ€™s where this Power BI dashboard steps in â€” a superhero in the world of data.

ðŸš€ What this Dashboard Unveils
âœ¨ Total Sales, Profit & Margin â€” the heartbeat of the business
âœ¨ Sales trends that tell the D-Mart growth story over time
âœ¨ Which city and category is making the cash registers sing
âœ¨ The top products customers canâ€™t get enough of
âœ¨ Which shipping mode rules the retail roads
âœ¨ How customer feedback shapes decisions

ðŸŽ¨ Why I built this
Because plain spreadsheets donâ€™t tell stories.
Because business data should be as easy to read as a price tag at D-Mart.
Because insights should feel like finding a great deal on your shopping trip!
